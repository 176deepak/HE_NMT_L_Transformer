# Hindi to English Translation(NMT) using Transformer(transformer from Scratch)

Welcome to the wild world of neural wizardry! 🧙‍♂️✨ This project is all about building a Transformer for Neural Machine Translation from scratch. We've broken down the adventure into four epic quests:

1. **Crafting a Hindi-English Tokenizer from scratch** 📝🔤 (because who doesn’t love some linguistic alchemy?)
2. **Summoning Word2Vec Word Embeddings from the ether** 💫📚 (training it from scratch, naturally)
3. **Conjuring up a Transformer Model from nothingness** 🧠⚡ followed by some intense training rituals
4. **Putting our creation to the test with Model Evaluation** 🧪📊

Get ready for a mind-bending journey through the mystical realms of NLP! 🚀🌟
